# WaterlooWorksPlus

Quality of life improvements to the WaterlooWorks website.

## Preamble

**The 5 million dollar question:** _why is the WaterlooWorks website so terrible?_

**The 0 dollar answer:** _Terrible coding practices, hidden form submissions, you name it._

Now, introducing **_WaterlooWorks+_**, an awesome ~~hack~~ browser extension to improve user experience on the WaterlooWorks website, just ever so slightly better than usual!

### Features

* Open job posting links in **New Tabs**
* Improved table formatting for job postings and dashboard messages to prevent need of scrolling horizontally
* Adds clickable links to the subject text for the dashboard message table (supports new tabs)
* Shortened some table header names for better visibility
* Adds extra pagination to the bottom of job postings page
* "Back to top" anchor at the bottom of job posting pages
* Repositioned "Back Buttons" directly above and to the left of main content for ease of accessibility
* Stylish and persistent blue navigation panel to replace the ugly smoke colour
